This source tree is kept somewhat behind the "official" version found
on fianna.cs.uni.edu.  Here is what we know to remain:

* Support for native global array handler
* Support for client-server layer (as a compile-time option)

Also, we would like eventually add:
* Comprehensive test cases for libmumps
* Brutalizing tests for global array handlers
* Parser brutality tests (much less urgent)

in sym_() __label_lookup diabled - conflicts with libmpscpp.cpp
