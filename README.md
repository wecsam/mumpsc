# Open MUMPS Interpreter

This repository improves on the MUMPS interpreter by Professor Kevin C. O'Kane
at the University of Northern Iowa. It can use a native B-tree implementation
for the storage, or it can use a MySQL or PostgreSQL database. Visit [Professor
O'Kane's staff website](https://www.cs.uni.edu/~okane/) for more information.
