This directory contains test and example routines for access to the
Mumps btree routines from C++ programs.

To compile, use the following example:

mumpsc btree1.cpp

The resulting executable will be btree1

The bash script file checkout will run all the tests. The file
checkout.bat is for Windows systems.
