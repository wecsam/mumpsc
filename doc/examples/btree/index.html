<p>
These are examples of direct calls to the
MDH/Mumps native global array handler that can
support large btrees and data files.  
The btree tself
is stored in "key.dat" and may grow to 16 TB or more.  The stored data is in
"data.dat" and may grow to 2**64 bytes.  Keys
must be alphanumeric in the ASCII range 32 to 127 inclusive.
<p>
To use, follow the examples in this directory
or see the documentation in the MDH manual.
<p>
See the examples in "btest1.c" through "btest8.c" - these
contain checkout ruotines and also show how to perform
various operations. The file "checkout" contains the
Linux script to run  each of the test routines.
The defined symbol "NBR_ITERATIONS" governs
how many iterations the test routines will
make.  This number is typically 100,000 or more.
iIt is declared in btree.h and btree.h.in
<p>
To cycle through successively higher keys, see the example in
"btest4.c".  To cycle through successively lower keys, see example
in "btest5.c".	Note: the first key given must be ASCII collating
sequence lower/higher than the keys your are seeking.  Use blank (32)
for lowest and ~ (127) for the highest.	 To delete a key, see example
in "btest8.c" or deleted the key.dat and data.dat files.
